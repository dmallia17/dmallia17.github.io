### Hello, world, I'm Dan (Daniel/Danny/Dan, all fine by me).

In a nutshell, I am a recent graduate from Hunter College's Computer Science
Master's program, currently searching for work as an AI engineer. Aside from
long walks on the beach and pina coladas (ha-ha), if I'm not obsessing
over a new concept, algorithm or language (sorry but not sorry, functional
programming languages are like candy), I'm playing guitar or drums, taking in
some nature with the wife, or playing a strategy game - dare I say it, even a
**video** game (dun-dun-dun).

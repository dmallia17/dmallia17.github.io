### Hello, world, I'm Dan.

I am an AI generalist who has built a pipeline using graph neural networks and
transformers to predict surgical outcomes; researched and trained LLMs for
synthetic data generation; and developed deep learning models for detecting a
category of "roof clutter and street furniture".
I earned my Master's in Computer Science from Hunter College, where I applied
Bayesian networks for modeling pregnancy outcomes, developed computer
vision-based robot state machines, and explored game AI and reinforcement
learning.

When I'm not diving into a new concept, algorithm or language, you can find me
playing guitar or drums, taking in some nature with my wife, or playing a
strategy game - dare I say it, even a **video** game.

Hello, reader. If you'd like the short version (and a picture!) you can
check out [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.markdown %}); otherwise
prepare yourself for the cinematic masterpiece of a generation...well when
the movie comes out, I'll let you know.

For me, the question "when am I going to use this again?!" reeks of irony.
If only our tired-of-math protagonist, high school Dan, knew that years later
he would be spending many an hour, *voluntarily* - even **happily** - working
on math, he would indeed be very confused. *Pats MacBook gently* That's
right, my first academic love was undoubtedly history, so much so that when
it came to my undergraduate studies at Fordham University (Fordham College at
Lincoln Center) there was no doubt in my mind as to a major. The same love
carried me onto a Master's degree in history via a 5-year program, where I
wrote one very hefty thesis on the bizarre and fascinating trajectory of
European fascism from its prewar nationalist focus to, believe-it-or-not, a
post-war pan-European push. As ~~exhausting~~ enjoyable as this experience was,
I thought it best to go out into the world and get some good work experience
under my belt. After all, a job at the FBI, NSA, or another agency where I
could put my analytical and research abilities to work, was going to require
some solid professional background. 

So I went and did just that: I became a litigation paralegal at McLaughlin &
Stern, LLP, where I got to work with some wonderful and kind people, and learn
a lot along the way. Interestingly, what I learned about myself, was that I
was increasingly craving the satisfaction that only comes from creating
something. Some hands-on work on the family home - I can still smell the
paint and spackle now (maybe I should get that checked out) - was quite fun,
but wasn't going to be my career. In short order I found myself drawn more and
more to the unlimited digital medium: code. Moreover, artificial intelligence
and robotics just seemed so darn interesting; I mean who hasn't seen Iron Man
and gone running to the Arduino section at Micro Center to get started on
their own suit. After over two years as a paralegal, I laid down my legal
notepad, and started a computer science bachelor's degree at Hunter College.

Wouldn't you know it, years after proudly declaring to my desk that I would
never touch math again, I was back. Worse, I was back to the parts that
(not naming names) were covered *very* poorly in high school - combinations,
permutations and anything that might have fallen under the discrete math
umbrella. Yet I had never struggled with math before, and in fact was
typically at the top of my classes; I simply had not enjoyed it. And this is
where I feel the "right place, right time" mantra gains real meaning:
sometimes you can be exposed to what the you of 8 years later (or earlier,
or...from another dimension?) would find fascinating but you just aren't in
the right frame of mind for it yet. Thankfully the stars started to align
for me: I pushed past my discrete math terrors to becoming a TA for the
discrete math course and started to make all of my internal techno-babble
about AI more concrete by joining a lab group and studying computer vision
and robotics. In my final year for the degree, I even had the great privilege
of interning at Geopipe and immersing myself in deep learning and a really
fun small team environment. 

Knowing that much of the AI development world is looking for higher education
and that I still had much to learn, I went for Master's Degree: Part Deux.
Graduate work is always challenging, but honestly it was a blast. For
starters, I got to take courses on artificial intelligence (broad survey),
machine learning, reinforcement learning, simulation, parallel programming,
and advanced programming languages. Better yet, I became a graduate research
assistant under the incredible Dr. Anita Raja, and had the opportunity to
research and prototype an unsupervised pipeline for learning Bayesian networks
to tackle the very challenging task of predicting and preventing preterm
birth; this work became the basis of my thesis (link to come!), which also
included a hefty amount of work on discretization. Along the way, I had some
great fun with a number of projects, which I'll soon be adding a page for on
this website, and I'll keep adding to the collection as I make more!

Phew...that brings us to today, where I am currently on the hunt for work in AI
engineering. The academic setting is great, but right now I want to get out
into industry and get busy. Is a PhD on the horizon? Perhaps, but - and not to
brag - I'm running out of wall space for these diplomas.
